Created at semester 5 / 6 ( advanced C++ programming in the Technique).

Run TP2-Statistics\Release

This programm is run automatically using a specific software developped by my CEGEP teacher. 

The goal was for the student --me-- to get used to developing a statistics software using extern, personal libraries
with object-oriented recent C++ programming.

Hence the 'real' type, created by the teacher, and the use of libraries ('dev' file) conceived for this project.

Speed of processing is assessed for many types of data array (types of array are listed and printed in terminal)
