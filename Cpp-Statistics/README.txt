This programm cannot be run without the specific software (developped by my CEGEP teacher). 

The goal was for the student --me-- to get used to developing a statistics software using extern, personal libraries
with object-oriented recent C++ programming.

Hence the 'real' type, created by the teacher, and the use of libraries ('dev' file) conceived specifically for this project.
